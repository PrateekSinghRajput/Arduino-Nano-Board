Key Components:
Arduino Nano- Serves as the microcontroller to manage inputs from sensors, control the display, and handle Bluetooth communication.
Sensors- These can include digital (e.g., DHT11 for temperature and humidity) and analog sensors (e.g., potentiometer, gas sensors) for monitoring various environmental parameters.
16x2 LCD Display- Provides real-time data display from the sensors. It can be interfaced using the I2C protocol to reduce wiring complexity.
Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05/HC-06): Allows wireless communication with smartphones or other devices, enabling remote monitoring and control.
